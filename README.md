## Lego Mindstorms: Robot Inventor

---

#### This is a project skeleton for Python projects

Includes type hinted classes for developing outside the LEGO application.

#### Goals:

- Provide type hinted interfaces of the standard library in Mindstorms
- Provide type hinted interface for the `hub-api` by Lego
- Allow programming the hub outside the app

---

#### TODO:

- Add `Motor` class type hints and methods
- Check the `math` portion of Lego docs
- Add all of the `hub` API to here
- Add REPL support via `rshell`
